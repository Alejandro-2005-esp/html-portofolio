<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Valerian and the city of the 1000 planets</h3>
<p>I love it due to the different kinds of species shown in the movie and how they interact with each other, some political drama, but not like the star wars kind of just mindless battles</p>
<h4>4.5/5</h4>
<h3>The mitchel vs the machines</h3>
<p>Funny and really sweet when it comes to the family relationships of the characters</p>
<h4>4/5</h4>
<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>Love it, love my country in a movie, but i felt it very rushed</p>
<h4>3.5/5</h4>
